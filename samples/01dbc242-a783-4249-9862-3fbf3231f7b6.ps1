# Code to auto update the Address policy, GAL, OAB and storage groups and mailbox databases of an Exchange 2007 server by John McLear
# This code is good for hosting providers or people who wish to use lots of storage groups and mailbox databases.

# PRE REQ - Create a container in your address lists called "Generic Address Book" or something similar - this is where we will store address lists!
	  - Create a public folder database on your MB server - In $publicfolderDatabase our example is in storage group sg0 called Public Folder.

# We need to set some things manually too!
$yourinternaldomain = "domain.com" # ie contoso.com
$OABDistributionServer = "CASserver" # Your CAS server responsible for OAB distribution
$MailboxServer = "MBserver" # Shortname of your MailboxServer
$PublicFolderDatabase = $MailboxServer + '\\sg0\\Public Folder' # The Path to your public folder used for Address List distribution
$LogFilePath = "d:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\Mailbox\\First Storage Group\\" # Where we will put the log files
$AdminName = "CN=Servers,CN=Exchange Administrative Group (TESTING23TESTY),CN=Administrative Groups,CN=Contoso,CN=Microsoft Exchange,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=com" # This needs to be changed

echo "Fullname: $fullname" # full name of customer - this must be a unique value)
echo "Domain name: $mail2" # customers domain name ie fraggle.com
echo "Type of customer (1 is basic, 2 is standard, 3 is premium): $typeofcustomer" # Basically a premium customer will get their own mailboxdatabase - a basic or standard will share in one big database (know why before you use this!)
echo "Your internal domain: $yourinternaldomain" # The internal domain you set 

# Lets go!
